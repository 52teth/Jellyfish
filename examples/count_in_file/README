What is it?
===========

Given a number of jellyfish databases, it outputs for all the k-mers
(in the union of the database) the number of occurrences in each of
the database. The output is a column format where the first column is
the k-mer and the remaining columns are the counts in each of the
databases, in the same order as given on the command line.

For example:

$ ./count_in_file db1.jf db2.jf
GCCACGACTCGTGCA 1 0
CAAGCTGTGTGGCCG 0 2
CATAGAAATCGATAA 3 5
TACTATATAAGCAAA 2 0
...
